ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a multi-talented personality with muti-hobbies in the HCI, tech, yoga, writing, reading, and dancing communities. 

I worked in the AI industry for 6 years(until 2022). I was a respected team leader and product manager in predominant AI companies, having led, organized, and mentored numerous AI product designs and businesses. Since 2022, I quit my promising job to pursue an academic career in HCI. I am an HCI research beginner and MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. My main interests are all related to Body/Brain interactions, specifically in Affective Interaction, Human Brain/Body Interface, Fabrication, Shape Changing Interface,  Sensing \& Computing, XR/Human AI Interaction, body-centered design, and wearables.

As a 5-year Yogi, I love to share my knowledge and experience through articles and videos, and 1k+ fans from all social media have followed me. 

As an amateur writer, I have written hundreds of articles on documentary proses, AI product opinions, and book recommendations, almost published in my online blog in China. Two articles have been selected to be published in a famous newspaper journal named "Guang Ming Daily" in China.
